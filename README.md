# @bitblit/Reversor

A framework to play reversi by implementing an interface

## Introduction

This library is made for developers to be able to easily run Reversi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi)
tournaments.  Basically, implement the Player class, and then instantiate the Game object with two players and
see who wins.  Simple.

## Dependencies

Doesn't really have any.

# Testing

Ha! No, seriously - all testing is done using Jest.  To run them:

`yarn test`
