# @bitblit/Reversor

A framework to play reversi by implementing an interface

## Introduction

This library is made for developers to be able to easily run Reversi - also called Othello -
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) tournaments.  Basically, implement the Player class, and then 
instantiate the Game object with two players and see who wins.  Simple.

If you are still stumped, check out the sample players in the players folder.  Both are really stupid and should be 
*pretty* easy to beat with even a little intelligence.

For the pedantic, yes, *I KNOW* that Othello is a solved game for 4x4 and 6x6 (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Othello).
Not really relevant for these purposes.

## Dependencies

Doesn't really have any.

# Testing

Ha! No, seriously - all testing is done using Jest.  To run them:

`yarn test`

# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, although I'm not sure why you'd be interested!
